Amaranth Toolset
========

Repository for Amaranth, a Blender Addon and Theme.

Yet another addon for Blender 2.6+, basically a bunch of tools that I believe improve usability on production environments.


##How to Install
* Download the latest .zip
* In Blender, go to the User Preferences under File menu > User Preferences, or hit Ctrl + Alt+ U
* Switch to the Addons tab. Click on the "Install from File" button on the header, look for the .zip file.
* Installed! You should see it on the list, but grayed out. Now you need to enable it by clicking on the box at the right. Then save your settings.
* Optional: All options will be enabled by default, but you can disable some on the Amaranth Toolset panel under Scene properties.
